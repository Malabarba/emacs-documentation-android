Emacs Documentation
===========================

This is the project page for the Emacs Documentation android app.

The app contains a (searchable) list of *all* emacs variables and
functions, as well as their documentations.  
For more information (and downloads), see the actual project website
[here](http://bruce-connor.github.io/emacs-online-documentation/).

Code available here depends on
[HugeSQLiteCursor](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/hugesqlitecursor/)
(an android lib developed by me) and
[actionbarsherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/).
